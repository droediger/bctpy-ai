    #   Generates synthetic networks and evaluates their energy function (see
    #   below) using the models described in the study by Betzel et al (2016)
    #   in Neuroimage.
    #
    #   Inputs:
    #           A,          binary network of seed connections
    #           Atgt,       binary network against which synthetic networks are
    #                       compared
    #           D,          Euclidean distance/fiber length matrix
    #           m,          number of connections that should be present in
    #                       final synthetic network
    #           modeltype,  specifies the generative rule (see below)
    #           modelvar,   specifies whether the generative rules are based on
    #                       power-law or exponential relationship
    #                       ({'powerlaw'}|{'exponential})
    #           params,     either a vector (in the case of the geometric
    #                       model) or a matrix (for all other models) of
    #                       parameters at which the model should be evaluated.
    #
    #   Outputs:
    #           B,          m x number of networks matrix of connections
    #           E,          energy for each synthetic network
    #           K,          Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics for each synthetic
    #                       network.
    #
    #   Full list of model types:
    #   (each model type realizes a different generative rule)
    #
    #       1.  'sptl'          spatial model
    #       2.  'neighbors'     number of common neighbors
    #       3.  'matching'      matching index
    #       4.  'clu-avg'       average clustering coeff.
    #       5.  'clu-min'       minimum clustering coeff.
    #       6.  'clu-max'       maximum clustering coeff.
    #       7.  'clu-diff'      difference in clustering coeff.
    #       8.  'clu-prod'      product of clustering coeff.
    #       9.  'deg-avg'       average degree
    #       10. 'deg-min'       minimum degree
    #       11. 'deg-max'       maximum degree
    #       12. 'deg-diff'      difference in degree
    #       13. 'deg-prod'      product of degree
    #
    #   Note: Energy is calculated in exactly the same way as in Betzel
    #   et al (2016). There are four components to the energy are KS statistics
    #   comparing degree, clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality, and 
    #   edge length distributions. Energy is calculated as the maximum across
    #   all four statistics.
