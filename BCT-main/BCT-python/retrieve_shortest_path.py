    # RETRIEVE_SHORTEST_PATH        Retrieval of shortest path
    #
    #   This function finds the sequence of nodes that comprise the shortest
    #   path between a given source and target node.
    #
    #   Inputs:
    #       s,
    #           Source node: i.e. node where the shortest path begins. 
    #    	t,
    #           Target node: i.e. node where the shortest path ends.
    #       hops,
    #           Number of edges in the path. This matrix may be obtained as the
    #           second output argument of the function "distance_wei_floyd.m".
    #       Pmat,
    #           Pmat is a matrix whose elements {k,t} indicate the next node in
    #           the shortest path between k and t. This matrix may be obtained
    #           as the third output of the function "distance_wei_floyd.m"
    #
    #   Output:
    #       path,
    #           Nodes comprising the shortest path between nodes s and t.
