def distance_wei_floyd(D, transform=None):
    """
    Distance matrix (Floyd-Warshall algorithm)

    Computes the topological length of the shortest possible path connecting every pair of nodes in the network.

    Args:
        D (numpy.ndarray): Weighted/unweighted directed/undirected connection *weight* OR *length* matrix.
        transform (str, optional): If the input matrix is a connection *weight* matrix, specify a transform that maps input connection weights to connection lengths.  Two transforms are available: 'log' -> l_ij = -log(w_ij), 'inv' -> l_ij = 1/w_ij. If the input matrix is a connection *length* matrix, do not specify a transform (or specify an empty transform argument). Defaults to None.


    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            SPL (numpy.ndarray): Unweighted/Weighted shortest path-length matrix. If D is a directed matrix, then SPL is not symmetric.
            hops (numpy.ndarray): Number of edges in the shortest path matrix. If D is unweighted, SPL and hops are identical. Only returned if nargout > 1 in MATLAB.
            Pmat (numpy.ndarray): Elements {i,j} of this matrix indicate the next node in the shortest path between i and j. This matrix is used as an input argument for a function that returns the sequence of nodes comprising the shortest path between a given pair of nodes. Only returned if nargout > 1 in MATLAB.

    Notes:
        There may be more than one shortest path between any pair of nodes in the network. Non-unique shortest paths are termed shortest path degeneracies, and are most likely to occur in unweighted networks. When the shortest-path is degenerate, The elements of matrix Pmat correspond to the first shortest path discovered by the algorithm.

        The input matrix may be either a connection weight matrix, or a connection length matrix. The connection length matrix is typically obtained with a mapping from weight to length, such that higher weights are mapped to shorter lengths (see above).
