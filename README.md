# bctpy-ai

## Overview
bctpy-ai is a personal project/exercise aiming to produce an up-to-date matlab-to-python translation of [Brain Connectivity Toolbox](https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/home?authuser=0) with the aid of Google's Gemini LLM. At this early stage, the translated functions have not been tested and should not be used, but I am working on ensuring that all functions work and produce identical output to the original MATLAB functions.
